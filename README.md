# js_password_generator
Week 3 javascript homework challenge

The purpose of this website is to allow the user to the use to generate a random password with a specific chosen number of characters (between 8 - 128 characters). The random password is then written on the page.

The user will have the choice of whether or not to include:
    - Special characters 
    - Lower case characters
    - Upper case characters
    - Numerical characters

Features:
    - All boolean values of window.confirm questions are logged in console for easy checking
    - If response is invalid, this is also console logged. An invalid response also prompts a window alert with more specific instructions

Things that can be improved:
    - The extensive if/else statements could potentially be trimmed down with more resourceful use of logical comparison operators

The following image demonstrates the functionality of the page with a view of the console:
